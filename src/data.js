        "I am student of a third year at AGH University of Science and Technology at the faculty of computer science and econometrics. I am solution oriented software engineer with willingness to learn different technologies, who is not afraid of new challanges. I have over one year experience as a software developer. My adventure with programming started 4 years ago, with easy algo trading bot wrote in C, and blog made in wordpress where I wanted to describe usage of that bot. Immediately I realised that I want to connect my career with web development and I have started learning diffrent technologies. I focus on full-stack development mainly with React for front-end purposes, Node.js and python on back-end, but also I am familiar with object oriented programming, SOLID, DRY and KISS priciples. Currently I am trying to pass AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification to expand my knowledge of cloud technologies.",
